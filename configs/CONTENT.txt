This directory contains configuration files used by the various libraries files.
It typically defines usefull constants but also path to external libraries.
In some cases some actual code is executed but this is typically to initialize
system wide variables or to define autoloaders, etc.

Files should be in the form of configXXX or localConfigXXX where XXX is 
the name of a library file. localConfiglXXX file are not ignored when commited
so that the parameters inside of them are not disclosed. This typically
serve for storing access to databases with passwords and this kind of things.
